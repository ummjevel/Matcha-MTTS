    ### [Shivam Mehta](https://www.kth.se/profile/smehta), [Ruibo Tu](https://www.kth.se/profile/ruibo), [Jonas Beskow](https://www.kth.se/profile/beskow), [√âva Sz√©kely](https://www.kth.se/profile/szekely), and [Gustav Eje Henter](https://people.kth.se/~ghe/)
    We propose üçµ Matcha-TTS, a new approach to non-autoregressive neural TTS, that uses conditional flow matching (similar to rectified flows) to speed up ODE-based speech synthesis. Our method:


    * Is probabilistic
    * Has compact memory footprint
    * Sounds highly natural
    * Is very fast to synthesise from


    Check out our [demo page](https://shivammehta25.github.io/Matcha-TTS). Read our [arXiv preprint for more details](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03199).
    Code is available in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/shivammehta25/Matcha-TTS), along with pre-trained models.

    Cached examples are available at the bottom of the page.
